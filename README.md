NOTE: ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, OPERATE ON YOUR OWN RISK. This program is a DOS attacker and a ransomware. It is easy to operate and tunnels your requests through Tor. It lets you inspect the status of every request to the server you make and through Tor, it masks a diffrent IP address with every connection you make.This creates a illusion that the traffic in question is of a 'natural audience'. You can choose while DOS attacking to enable Tor or not, because it can slow the attack down. It can also act like a ransomware because of a flaw in Chrome. That Chrome blocks your IP address if you spam more than 99 times to a website. So if you remotly control this program and send 100 connections to a website without masking the victim's IP address with Tor, you can block their IP address.
